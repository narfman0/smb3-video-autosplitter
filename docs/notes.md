# Notes

We need to maintain score to avoid or incur lag frames. The current TAS
skips lag frames in 2-1 and 2f but gets them in 2-2. So make sure your score
IS past the threshold in 2-2.

1-Airship is all about setting yourself up for
success at the end of 2-1. So get any of the following:
65660 before 243 firekill, bonk strats for EZ 243
65610 before 244 firekill
65560 before 245 firekill, fast strat
2-1: Skip the final goomba in 2-1 if you are ahead, or kill the extra pirahnas if
you are behind for the hundredths place.
2-2: A little hop before the hill helps control the speed variance. Get 2, 3,
or 4 coins for 50 modifications.
